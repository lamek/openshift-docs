This guide walks through setting up your first {product-title} cluster using `moactl`, the {product-title} command line utility.

If you have already installed the required prerequisites, here are the commands you need to create a cluster.

[source, bash]
----
## Configures your AWS account and ensures everything is setup correctly
$ moactl init

## Starts the cluster creation process (~30-40minutes)
$ moactl create cluster --name <my-cluster-name>

## Watch your logs as your cluster creates
$ moactl logs cluster <my-cluster-name> --watch

## Connect your IDP to your cluster
$ moactl create idp --cluster <my-cluster-name>  --interactive

## Promotes a user from your IDP to admin level
$ moactl create user --cluster <my-cluster-name> --dedicated-admins <admin-username>        

## Checks if your install is ready (look for State: Ready),
## and provides your Console URL to login to the web console.
$ moactl describe cluster <my-cluster-name>
----

For additional help, consult the rest of this guide for steps on setting up and running an {product-title} cluster on your AWS account.

By the end of this guide you will have an Amazon Red Hat OpenShift cluster running in your AWS account.
