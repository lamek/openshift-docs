I: Creating cluster with identifier '1de87g7c30g75qechgh7l5b2bha6r04e' and name 'rh-moa-test-cluster1'
I: To view list of clusters and their status, run `moactl list clusters`
I: Cluster 'rh-moa-test-cluster1' has been created.
I: Once the cluster is 'Ready' you will need to add an Identity Provider and define the list of cluster administrators. See `moactl create idp --help` and `moactl create user --help` for more information.
I: To determine when your cluster is Ready, run `moactl describe cluster rh-moa-test-cluster1`.
