= Installing prerequisites

Complete the following prerequisites before creating your {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure

. Select the AWS account you want to use.
+
Unless you are just testing out {product-title}, it is recommended to use a dedicated AWS account to run any production clusters. If you are using AWS Organizations, you can use an AWS account within your organization or link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-new[create a new one].
+
If you are using AWS organizations and you need to have a Service Control Policy (SCP) applied to the AWS account you plan to use, see the link:https://www.openshift.com/dedicated/ccs#scp[Red Hat Requirements for Customer Cloud Subscriptions] for details on the minimum required SCP.
+
As part of the cluster creation process, `moactl` will create an osdCcsAdmin IAM user. This user will leverage the IAM credentials you provide when configuring the AWS CLI.
+
[NOTE]
====
This user will have Programmatic access enabled and the AdministratorAccess policy attached to it.
====
+
. Install and configure the AWS CLI.
.. Follow the link:https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS Command Line Interface] documentation to install and configure the AWS CLI for your operating system.
.. Optional: Set a default AWS region. `moactl` evaluates regions in the following priority order:
+
... The region specified when running a `moactl` command with the `--region` flag.
... The region set in the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html[Environment variables to configure the AWS CLI] in the AWS documentation.
... The default region set in your AWS configuration file. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config[Quick configuration with aws configure] in the AWS documentation.
.. Verify the AWS CLI is installed and configured correctly by running the following command to query the AWS API:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws ec2 describe-regions

. Install `moactl`, the {product-title} Command-line Interface (CLI).
.. Download the latest release of `moactl` for your operating system from link:https://github.com/openshift/moactl/releases/latest[the `moactl` releases page on GitHub].
.. Optional: Rename the executable file you downloaded to `moactl`. This documentation uses `moactl` to refer to the executable file.
.. Optional: Add `moactl` to your path.
.. Verify your installation by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ moactl

[source,terminal]
----
$ moactl completion > /etc/bash_completion.d/moactl
----
+
Add this file to the correct location for your operating system. For example, on a Linux machine run the following command to enable `moactl` bash completion:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ source /etc/bash_completion.d/moactl
----
+
. Run the following command to verify that your AWS account has the necessary permissions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ moactl verify permissions
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Validating SCP policies...
I: AWS SCP policies ok
----
+
. Verify that your AWS account has the necessary quota to deploy an {product-title} cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ moactl verify quota --region=us-west-2
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Validating AWS quota...
I: AWS quota ok
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Sometimes your AWS quota varies by region. If you receive any errors, try a different region.
====
+
If you need to increase your quota, navigate to your link:https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS console], and request a quota increase for the service that failed.
+
After both the permissions and quota checks pass, proceed to preparing your AWS account for cluster deployment.
+
. Prepare your AWS account for cluster deployment
+
.. Run the following command to log in to your Red Hat account with `moactl`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ moactl login
----
+
Replace `<my_offline_access_token>` with your token.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
To login to your Red Hat account, get an offline access token at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/token/moa
? Copy the token and paste it here: <my-offline-access-token>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not already have a Red Hat account, link:https://cloud.redhat.com/[follow this link to create one]. Accept the required terms and conditions. Then, check your email for a verification link.
