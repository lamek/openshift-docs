= About Installing Metering

Metering leverages a SQL database called Presto.
Presto does not store the data itself. Instead, its storage is decoupled from it, often in the form of object storage.
This means at a minimum you need to configure persistent storage to hold reporting data, and the Hive metastore to hold metadata about database tables managed by Presto and Hive.

The Hive metastore must be configured when first installing metering, and it cannot be changed or updated after installation. If you do not add any configuration settings for the Hive metastore, the default settings are used. The defaut configuration settings for the Hive metastore work for small clusters, but users may wish to improve performance or move storage requirements out of cluster by using a dedicated SQL database for storing the Hive metastore data.
