= Troubleshooting metering

A common issue with metering is Pods failing to start. Pods may fail to start due to lack of resources, or if they have a dependency on a resource that does not exist, such as a `StorageClass` or `Secret`.

== Not enough compute resources

A common issue when installing or running metering is lack of compute resources. Ensure that metering is allocated the minimum resource requirements described in the installation prerequisites.

To determine if the issue is with resources or scheduling, follow the troubleshooting instructions included in the Kubernetes document https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#troubleshooting[Managing Compute Resources for Containers].

If a container's status is `pending`, the issue is most likely with scheduling.

== StorageClass not configured

Metering requires that a default `StorageClass` be configured for dynamic provisioning.

See the documentation on configuring metering for information on how to check if there are any `StorageClasses` configured for the cluster, how to set the default, and how to configure metering to use a `StorageClass` other than the default.

== Secret not configured correctly

A common issue with metering is providing the incorrect secret when configuring your persistent storage. Be sure to review the example configuration files and create you secret according to the guidelines for your storage provider.
