= Metering overview

Metering is general purpose data analysis tool that enables you to write Reports to process data from different data sources.
As a cluster administrator, you can use Metering to analyze what is happening in your cluster.
You can either write your own, or use predefined SQL queries to define how you want to process data from the different data sources you have available.

Metering focuses primarily on in-cluster metric data using Prometheus as a default data source, enabling users of Metering to do reporting on pods, namespaces, and most other Kubernetes resources.
