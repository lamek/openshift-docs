Knative Client (`kn`) is the Knative command line interface (CLI). The CLI exposes commands for managing your applications, as well as lower level tools to interact with components of {product-title}. With `kn`, you can create applications and manage {product-title} projects from the terminal. 

Knative client does not have its own log in mechanism. To log in to the cluster you must install the `oc` CLI and use the `oc` login. Installation options for the CLI vary depending on your operating system.
